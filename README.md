# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the Iris dataset using various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression. The goal is to classify iris species based on their features and evaluate the performance of different models.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features:
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of three classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, or Iris Virginica.

## Models Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A classification algorithm that predicts the class of a sample based on the classes of its nearest neighbors.
- **Linear Regression**: Used to predict continuous values; in this context, it can be applied to predict petal or sepal dimensions.
and many more
